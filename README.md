# hello-world
Mom of CrazyChickenStew.  Some how I got his owner name.  See how much I know.  I have a lot to learn.
My teenage son wants me to have new skills that I can be more valuable to the workforce.  He suggested that I take this course.  Many moons ago he damaged the "d" key on my laptop ( He has a new gamimg laptop so, I am stuck with this one) so, I have to CNTRL+V to access the letter "d" when typing.  This a has ruined my touch typing.  I guess I can learn new tricks.  So here I am learning something new.  The goal is to improve myself to, mostly, keep my brain sharp.
